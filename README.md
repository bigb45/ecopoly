# Ecopoly

A Sustainable game built using Flutter with the Casual Games Toolkit for the Global Gamers Challenge Hackathon

I built the game using Flutter, I used Audacity to edit the audio files, and Sketchbook to create and edit the image assets for the game. It was a learning experience for sure! I learned about game loops, audio editing, assets & how to create them among other things. I also learned a lot about the Flutter framework and its intricacies!
